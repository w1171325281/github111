	Loopback DAC to ADC example
	
	Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC1 and DAC to output on DAC_OUT1 sampled
values of ADC1.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC1 channel11 (PC.01).
The End Of Conversion (EOC) interrupt is enabled and the conversion is triggered by software.

The DAC channel 1 is configured with output buffer enabled.

Each time the end of conversion interrupt occurs, converted value by ADC1 is written
in DAC channel 1 register.
Thus applied voltage on ADC1 channel11 (PC.01) is outputted on DAC_OUT1 (PA4).

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a variable power supply 0-3.3V to ADC1 Channel11 mapped on pin PC.01
      (potentiometer RV3 can be used).
    - Connect PA4 (DAC_OUT1) pin to an oscilloscope.


	How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

	DAC Signals generation example

	Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the DAC peripheral to 
generate various signals using DMA controller.
When the user presses the KEY push-button, DMA transfers the selected waveform to DAC.

For each press on KEY button, One signal has been selected and monitored on the DAC Channel1
    - Escalator waveform (Channel 1).
    - Sine waveForm (Channel 1).
