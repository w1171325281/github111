	ADC DMA transfer to TIM3 example

	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer
continuously a data from a peripheral (ADC1) to another peripheral (TIM3) supporting
DMA transfer.The ADC channel11 is configured to be converted continuously. 
TIM3_CH1 is configured to generate a PWM signal on its output.

The dedicated DMA1 channel3 is configured to transfer in circular mode the last ADC 
channel11 converted value to the TIM3_CCR1 register. The DMA channel request is driven
by the TIM3 update event. The duty cycle of TIM3_CH1 output signal is then changed
each time the input voltage value on ADC channel11 pin is modified.

The duty cycle variation can be visualized on oscilloscope on the TIM3_CH1 pin
PA.06 while changing the analog input on ADC channel11 using the potentiometer.

	DMA FLASH to RAM example
	
	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer 
a word data buffer from FLASH memory to embedded SRAM memory.

DMA1 Channel1 is configured to transfer the contents of a 32-word data buffer
stored in Flash memory to the reception buffer declared in RAM.

The start of transfer is triggered by software. DMA1 Channel1 memory-to-memory
transfer is enabled. Source and destination addresses incrementing is also enabled.
The transfer is started by setting the Channel enable bit for DMA1 Channel1.
At the end of the transfer, a Transfer Complete interrupt is generated since it
is enabled. Once interrupt is generated, the remaining data to be transferred is
read which must be equal to 0. The Transfer Complete Interrupt pending bit is
then cleared. A comparison between the source and destination buffers is done to
check that all data have been correctly transferred.

	DMA RAM to DAC example

	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use a DMA channel to transfer data 
buffer from RAM memory to DAC.

DMA1 channel3 is configured to transfer continuously, word by word, a Half-word 
buffer to the DAC register DAC_DHR12R. The DAC channel conversion is configured 
to be triggered by TIM2 TRGO triggers and without noise/triangle wave generation.
12bit right data alignment is selected since we choose to access DAC_DHR12R register.

You can monitor the DAC output waveform on PA.04 pin.
