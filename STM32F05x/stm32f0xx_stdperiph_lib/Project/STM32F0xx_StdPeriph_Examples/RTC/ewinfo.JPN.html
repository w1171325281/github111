	RTC Hardware Calendar Description

	Example Description 

This example demonstrates and explains how to use the RTC peripheral.
As an application example, it demonstrates how to setup the RTC peripheral, in 
terms of prescaler and interrupts, to be used to keep time and to generate 
alarm interrupt. 

One from the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c): 
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The RTC is in the backup (BKP) domain, still powered by VBAT when VDD is switched off,
so the RTC configuration is not lost if a battery is connected to the VBAT pin. 
A key value is written in backup data register 0 to indicate if the RTC is already
configured

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:
    - BKP_DR0 value not correct: (RTC_BKP_DR0 value is not correct or has not yet
      been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
      configured and the user is asked to set the time and alarm (entered on 
      HyperTerminal).
      LED2 is truned ON when the RTC configuration is done correctly.

    - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      and Alarm A are displayed on HyperTerminal.

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost.

3. When power on reset occurs:
    - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is not reset and
      the RTC configuration is not lost.
      
    - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is reset and the
      RTC configuration is lost.

4. When an RTC Alarm A event occurs the RTC Alarm interrupt is generated and the
   LED1 is toggled.
   
The example uses HyperTerminal to configure the RTC clock and display the current time:
 - When Joystcick SEL button is pressed, a menu is displayed to configure the RTC Time 
   and Alarm A registers.
 - When Key button is pressed, the current time is displayed.
 - When Joystcick UP button is pressed, the current alarm A is displayed.

	RTC_LSI RTC prescaler adjustment with LSI Measurements example

	Example Description 

This example demonstrates and explains how to use the LSI clock source auto
calibration to get a precise RTC clock. 
As an application example, it demonstrates how to configure the TIM14 timer
internally connected to LSI clock output, in order to adjust the RTC prescaler. 

The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source.
After reset, the RTC prescaler (asynchronous and synchronous) is set with the 
default LSI frequency (40KHz).
The RTC Alarm is configured to generate an interrupt each 1s. LED1 is toggled 
inside the RTC WakeUp interrupt each 1s.

The inaccuracy of the LSI clock causes the RTC Alarm Interrupt to be inaccurate.
The RTC CK_SPRE signal can be monitored by LED1 which is toggled into the RTC 
Alarm_A interrupt service routine.

The program waits until Key Push button is pressed to begin the auto calibration 
procedure:
 - Configure the TIM14 to remap internally the TIM14 Channel 1 Input Capture to 
   the LSI clock output.
 - Enable the TIM14 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
   period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
   its real value.
 - The RTC prescaler is adjusted with this LSI frequency value so that the RTC
   CK_SPRE value become more accurate.
 - When calibration is done LED2 is turned ON to indicate the end of this operation.

	RTC StopWatch example
	
	Example Description 

  This example illustrates how to use the STM32F0xx new RTC's sub-seconds and
  Tamper feature (Filter, sampling) features. It simulates a precise chronometer
  with 2 record times possibilities stored in the Backup registers (2 registers
  for time (second, minutes and hours) and 2 registers for subsecond).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using
   LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use StopWatch with real time display.

  After startup, a default 00:00:00:000 chronometer counter is displayed on the 
  LCD, it correspond to [Hours]:[minutes]:[seconds]:[milliseconds].
  User can manipulate the chronometer features using Joystick LEFT, RIGHT and Tamper buttons:
    - press Joystick LEFT  button to start counter.
    - press Joystick RIGHT button to save trials in the backup registers (max 5 actions).
    - press and hold Tamper button for 1 sec to reset all the backup registers.

	RTC Timer example
	
	Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral’s with 
Alarm sub seconds feature to simulate a timer with refresh time equal to 250 ms
(1 second/ 8) * 2).

The RTC is configured to generate sub seconds interrupt each 125ms (will have
8 interrupt per 1 second).
  
For this example an interactive human interface is developed using LCD and buttons
to allow user to use Timer with a real "sand timer" display.

After startup, the sand timer is equal to 1 Minute (60 Seconds) and by pressing on
the RIGHT button the bottom bulb start to be filled for each 2 successive interrupts (after each 250ms).
After 480 interrupts (60 * 8) the bottom bulb will be full.

User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Joystick LEFT, RIGHT, UP and DOWN buttons:
  - press Joystick RIGHT button to Start the timer.
  - press again Joystick RIGHT button to stop the timer.
  - press Joystick LEFT button to Restart the timer.
  - press Joystick  UP/DOWN button to adjust the timer.

	RTC Tamper example

	Example Description 

This example shows how to write/read data to/from RTC Backup data registers and 
demonstrates the Tamper detection feature.

One from the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c):
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The associated firmware performs the following:
1. It configures the Tamper pin to be falling edge, and enables the Tamper interrupt.
2. It writes the data to all RTC Backup data registers, then check whether the 
   data were correctly written. If yes, LED1 turns on, otherwise LED3 turns on.
3. On applying a low level on the RTC_AF1 pin (PC.13, connected to Tamper button), 
   the RTC backup data registers are reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated. 
   The corresponding ISR then checks whether the RTC Backup data registers are cleared.
   If yes LED2 turns ON, otherwise LED4 turns ON.

	RTC Time Stamp example
	
	Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the RTC peripheral and 
the Time Stamp feature.

One from the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
corresponding define in main.c):
  - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
  - LSI oscillator clock

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:
    - BKP_DR0 value not correct: (RTC_BKP_DR0 value is not correct or has not yet
      been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
      configured and the user is asked to set the time and date (entered on 
      HyperTerminal).
    
    - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      date and timestamp (time and date) are displayed on HyperTerminal.

2. When an External Reset occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC configuration
   is not lost.

3. When power on reset occurs:
    - If a battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is not reset and
      the RTC configuration is not lost.
      
    - If no battery is connected to the VBAT pin: the BKP domain is reset and the
      RTC configuration is lost.

4. It configures the RTC_AF1 pin TimeStamp to be falling edge and enables the
TimeStamp detection.

5. On applying a low level on the RTC_AF1 pin (PC.13), the calendar is saved in 
the time-stamp registers thanks to the timestamp event detection.
   
The example uses HyperTerminal to configure the RTC clock, display the current 
time and timestamp registers contents:
 - pressing Tamper button, the current time and date are saved in RTC TSTR
   and TSDR registers.
 - When pressing Joystick SEL button, the TimeStamp Calendar is cleared.
 - When pressing Key button, the current RTC Calendar (Time and date) and
   RTC TimeStamp Calendar (Time and date) are displayed.
