	PWR Current Consumption example

	Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the STM32F0xx system to measure different
Low Power modes current consumption. The Low Power modes are:
  - Sleep Mode
  - STOP mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode without RTC 
  - STANDBY mode with RTC

To run this example, user has to follow the following steps:
 1. Select the Low power modes to be measured by uncommenting the corresponding
    line inside the stm32f0xx_lp_modes.h file.
       /*#define SLEEP_MODE*/
       /*#define STOP_MODE*/
       /*#define STANDBY_MODE*/
       #define STANDBY_RTC_MODE

 2. Use an external amperemeter to measure the IDD current. 

 3. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode as the JTAG IOs are disabled to
    reduce power consumption.

Here below a detailed description of the example code:

 1. After reset, the program waits for KEY button connected to the PB.08 to be 
    pressed to enter the selected low power mode.
     - In SLEEP_MODE, press again the KEY button to exit the low power mode.
     - In STOP_MODE and STANDBY_RTC_MODE, the wakeup from low power mode is automatically 
       generated by the RTC (after ~5s).
     - In STANDBY_MODE test, press again Tamper button to exit the low power mode.
     
 2. Low power modes description:

    - Sleep Mode
    ============  
            - System Running at PLL (48MHz)
            - Flash 1 wait state

            - All peripherals disabled.
            - Wakeup using EXTI Line 8 (PB.08, connected to Key push-button on STM320518-EVAL)

    - STOP Mode

	PWR STANDBY Mode Example

	Example Description 

This example shows how to enter the system to STANDBY mode and wake-up from this
mode using RTC Alarm.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 48 MHz, the SysTick is programmed
to generate an interrupt each 250 ms. In the SysTick interrupt handler, the LED3 is
toggled, this is used to indicate whether the MCU is in STANDBY or RUN mode.

When a falling edge is detected on the PB8(pressing on user button), the RTC is 
configured to generate an Alarm event in 3 seconds then the system enters STANDBY 
mode causing the LED3 to stop toggling. 
An external RESET will wake-up the system from STANDBY. If within 3 seconds an 
external RESET is not generated, the RTC Alarm will wake-up the system. 

After wake-up from STANDBY mode, program execution restarts in the same way as after
a RESET, the LED3 is toggling again,the RTC configuration(clock source, enable, prescaler,...) 
is kept.
As result there is no need to configure the RTC.

Led LED3 is used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED3 toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED3 off : system in STANDBY mode

 note To measure the current consumption in STANDBY mode, please refer to 
      PWR_CurrentConsumption example.

	PWR STOP example

	Example Description 

This example shows how to enter the system to STOP mode and wake-up using EXTI
Line interrupts. The EXTI Line sources are PB8 and RTC Alarm.

The EXTI line8 is configured to generate interrupt on falling edge.
The EXTI line17(RTC Alarm) is configured to generate interrupt on rising edge.

The system enters and exits STOP mode as following:
After system start-up, the RTC is configured to generate an Alarm event then the 
system enters STOP mode. To wake-up from STOP mode you have to apply a falling
edge on EXTI line8, otherwise the  RTC Alarm will wake-up the system within 5 
seconds. After exit from STOP, the system clock is reconfigured to its previous 
state (as HSE and PLL are disabled in STOP mode).
Then, after a delay the system will enter again in STOP mode and exit in the way
described above. This behavior is repeated in an infinite loop.

Three leds are used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED1 ON: system in RUN mode
 - LED1, LED2 and LED4 OFF: system in STOP mode
 - LED2 ON if EXTI Line8 is used to exit from STOP
 - LED4 ON if EXTI line17(RTC Alarm) is used to exit from STOP 
  note To measure the current consumption in STOP mode, please refer to 
      PWR_CurrentConsumption example.
