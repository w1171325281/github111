	FLASH Program example

	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to program the STM32F0xx FLASH.

After Reset, the Flash memory Program/Erase Controller is locked. To unlock it,
the FLASH_Unlock function is used.
Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using 
the flash erase page feature. The erase procedure starts with the calculation of
the number of pages to be used. Then all these pages will be erased one by one by
calling FLASH_ErasePage function. 

Once this operation is finished, the programming operation will be performed by 
using the FLASH_ProgramWord function. The written data is then checked and the
result of the programming operation is stored into the MemoryProgramStatus variable.

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


	How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

 note Known limitation:
       When running this example in debug mode with TrueSTUDIO or MDK-ARM toolchains,
       the connection with the debugger is lost. The problem does not occur when
       running step by step.

	FLASH Write Protection example

	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to enable and disable the write protection
for the STM32F0xx embedded FLASH.

- Enable Write protection: 
   To enable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_ENABLE"
   in main.c file.  
   To protect a set of pages, the user has to call the function FLASH_EnableWriteProtection.
   The parameter of this function will define the number of pages to be protected.
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.
 
- Disable Write protection:
   To disable the Write Protection, uncomment the line "#define WRITE_PROTECTION_DISABLE"
   in main.c file.
   To disable the write protection of the STM32F0xx Flash, an erase of the Option 
   Bytes is necessary. This operation is done by the function FLASH_EraseOptionBytes.
   To load the new option byte values, a system Reset is necessary, for this, the
   function FLASH_OB_Launch() is used.

If the desired pages are not write protected, an erase and a write operation are
performed.
