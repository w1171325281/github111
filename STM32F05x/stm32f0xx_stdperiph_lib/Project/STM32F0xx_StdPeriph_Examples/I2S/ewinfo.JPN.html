	I2S Data Exchange using DMA example

	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to set a communication between two SPIs
in I2S mode using DMA and performing a transfer from Master to Slave.

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them 
Board A and Board B) then connect these two boards through SPI lines and GND.
In the firmware example uncomment the dedicated line in the main.h file  to use
the SPI peripheral as STM32 Master device or as STM32 Slave .

 note
- The connection between the pins should use a short wires and a common Ground.

- Software Description

In master board, I2S peripheral is configured as Master Transmitter, whereas in 
Slave board, I2S peripheral is configured as Slave Receiver. The data transfer is 
managed with DMA. 
The both devices are in Philips standard configuration with 16bit extended to 
32 bit data packet and 48KHz audio frequency. 

The I2S_Buffer_Tx is transmitted using DMA1 channel3 and the received values are 
loaded in the I2S_Buffer_Rx buffer using DMA1 channel2. Only the significant 16 
MSBs are sent and received, while the 32 packet remaining 16 LSBs are filled with 0 values
and don't generate any interrupt.

When the user press on the Key Button on the Master Board, the master transmitter
start sending data stored in the I2S_Buffer_Tx buffer while the Slave Board receives
data I2S_Buffer_Rx buffer.

Once the transfer is completed a comparison is done and TransferStatus gives the 
data transfer status:
  - TransferStatus PASSED if transmitted and received data are the same: Green LED is On.
  - TransferStatus FAILED if transmitted and received data are the different: Red LED is on.

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

      - Two boards should be connected as follows:
        - Connect SPI1 SCK pin (PB.03) to SPI1 SCK pin (PB.03)
        - Connect SPI1 WS pin (PA.15) to SPI1 WS pin (PA.15)
        - Connect SPI1 SD pin (PB.05) to SPI1 SD pin (PB.05)
        - Connect Gnd pins of two boards. 


	How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

whereas in Slave board, I2S peripheral is configured as Slave Receiver with Interrupt. 
The both devices are in Philips standard configuration with 16bit extended to

The I2S transmit interrupt and the I2S receive interrupt are both enabled. And

values are loaded in the I2S_Buffer_Rx buffer. Only the significant 16 MSBs are
sent and received, while the 32 packet remaining 16 LSBs are filled with 0 values
