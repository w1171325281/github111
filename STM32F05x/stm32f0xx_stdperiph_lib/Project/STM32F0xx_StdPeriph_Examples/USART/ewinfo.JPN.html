	USART Hyperterminal interrupt Example

	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the USART1 with Transmit and Receive
interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.

First, the USART1 sends the TxBuffer to the hyperterminal and still waiting for 
a string from the hyperterminal that you must enter.The string that you have entered 
is stored in the RxBuffer array. The receive buffer have a RxBufferSize bytes as 
maximum (the reception is stopped when this maximum receive value is reached).

The USART1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

 note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

	USART AutoBaudRate Example
	
	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the Auto BaudRate capability
of the USART via the HyperTerminal.

First, the USART1 is configured to detect BaudRate automatically with StartBit
Measurement Method (Any character starting with a bit at 1 should be send to USART 
to detect Baud Rate).

After configuration, the USART waits until a data is received via HyperTerminal
to launch auto-detection of Baud Rate phase. The end of this phase is monitored 
by ABRF flag.

The result of auto-detection is indicated by EVAL Board LEDs. If an error occurred 
in Auto BaudRate phase ABRE flag is set and LED3 is turned on. If this phase is 
completed successfully, LED2 is turned on and the received data is transmitted back 
to the HyperTerminal.
You can repeat this procedure by changing the BaudRate on HyperTerminal side.
 
The USART1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud (any value can be chosen)  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits 
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

	USART Communication Boards Data Exchange using DMA example
	
	Example Description 

This example provides a small application in which joystick buttons are used 
to trigger USART communications using DMA and though using USART firmware library.

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

 note
- The connection between the pins should use a common Ground.

- Software Description

On Board A, at each joystick buttons press:
- The USART Board A sends the specific command to the USART Board B (the command 
  contains the transaction code (CMD_RIGHT, CMD_LEFT, CMD_UP, CMD_DOWN or CMD_SEL)
  followed by the number of data to be transmitted (CMD_RIGHT_SIZE, CMD_LEFT_SIZE, 
  CMD_UP_SIZE, CMD_DOWN_SIZE or CMD_SEL_SIZE)

- The USART Board B receives the command and sends the CMD_ACK command to the USART board A

- The USART Board A receives the CMD_ACK command and sends the number of bytes 
  from TxBuffer to the USART Board B.
  
- The USART Board B compares the number of bytes received with the defined ones into
  his TxBuffer.
  
  Received data correctness is signaled by LED lightening and though as follow:
   - Joystick RIGHT and data correctly received ==> LD2, LD3 ON and LD4 OFF 
   - Joystick LEFT and data correctly received  ==> LD4 ON, LD2 and LD3 are OFF
   - Joystick UP and data correctly received    ==> LD2 ON, LD3 and LD4 are OFF
   - Joystick DOWN and data correctly received  ==> LD3 ON, LD2 and LD4 are OFF
   - Joystick SEL and data correctly received   ==> LD2, LD3 and LD4 are ON

The steps described above can be also initiated and ensured by Board B. 

In both boards(Board A or Board B), the data transfers is managed using the USART 
Tx/Rx channels DMA requests.

The SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated counter 
inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle the LD1 each 100ms indicating that the 
firmware is running.

A defined communication timeout is insuring that the application will not remain 
stuck if the USART communication is corrupted.
You can adjust this timeout through the USER_TIMEOUT  define inside main.h file
depending on CPU frequency and application conditions (interrupts routines, 
number of data to transfer, baudrate, CPU frequency...).

These operations can be repeated infinitely.

	USART WakeUp from Stop mode Example
	
	Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the WakeUp from STOP mode capability
of the USART via the hyperterminal.

First, the USART1 is configured to WakeUp from STOP with StartBitMethod(when any
data is received on RX line).
After configuration, the MCU enters STOP mode and waits to be waken.
When a string is sent to USART1 via the hyperterminal, the MCU WakeUp from stop,
restore the system clock configuration and configures the systick to toggle LED's.
The LED's toggling is used to indicate that the MCU is Waken Up from stop.

The USART1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits 
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN7 and PC serial port.
    - Make sure that JP3 is in position 5<->6 

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - flow control: None
