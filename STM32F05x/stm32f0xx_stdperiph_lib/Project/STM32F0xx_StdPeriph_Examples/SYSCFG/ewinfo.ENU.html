	Programmable Voltage Detector (PVD) example

	Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the programmable voltage detector.

In this example:
  - TIM1 is configured to generate a PWM signal on pin PA.08.
  - PVD threshold is configured to level 5.
   
While Vdd is higher than the PVD threshold (~2.68 V), PWM signal is displayed on PA.08.
While Vdd is lower than the PVD threshold (~2.58 V), PA8 is in low level.

 note   Refer to the electrical characteristics of your device datasheet for more
        details about the voltage threshold corresponding to each PVD detection level.

	Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F0xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM320518-EVAL (STM32F0xx)
    evaluation board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM320518-EVAL Set-up
    - Use RV2 Potentiometer to adjust Vdd.
    - Make sure that jumper JP9 is in position(VDD_ADJ).
    - Connect an oscilloscope to PA.08 pin to display the waveform.


	How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F0xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
